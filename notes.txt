Todo :

* Datasets are conceptual groupings of data, called 'assets'. Assets are explicitly spatio-temporal data repositories, either as multi-band TIF, kml, csv etc.
* Datasets have a metadata file giving information on the overall dataset.
* Each Asset also has its own metadata file. Heirarchial relationship information comes from the directory structure.

* Web-queriable script to get information on dataset and each asset.

* Object oriented design in python. Take some cues from earth engine's conceptual structuring of data / process.



Calls / Operations:

command = {'operation': 'Window',
           'asset': asset,
           'window': bounds,
           'srs': EPSG4326_WKT,
           'srs_type': 'WKT',
           'window_size': [256,256],
           'output': 'PNG'
           }

           
SRS definitions are parsed by one of OSR's import functions. You can 
either supply a case-insensitve string designating what kind of spatial
reference string was passed in 'srs', or if missing, the API will take
a guess by passing the definition to OSR.SetFromUserInput().
